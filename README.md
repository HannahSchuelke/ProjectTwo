# LIST!N 

LIST!N is an online portal where you can keep track of your favorite artists when they come to town. You may customize your profile and add artists that you would like to see. As more friends join and more shows get added, this information will serve as reminders by populating your newsfeed. 

This is built using Node, Express, Sequelize, JSON Web Tokens, and a MVC Paradigm; for project two of UMN's Coding Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

First, go to https://git.heroku.com/project2listen.git and on the left-hand side of the webpage, login. If you have not done this already, you will be prompted to create a username and password, and then you will be redirected to your profile to personalize that if you like. After this is done, you will be redirected to your newsfeed, which will populate with customized data from your profile and other users. 

### Prerequisites

Using this web portal requires no installation, though you may want to have a photo saved locally and shows your like to see [or see again] in mind, in order to customize your profile and later generate your newsfeed. 

### How to use locally

1. Direct or `cd` yourself in terminal to a root folder where you'd like to test our project. 
2. Go to https://github.com/HannahSchuelke/ProjectTwo and clone the repository, or type `git clone git@github.com:HannahSchuelke/ProjectTwo.git` into that same root folder.  
3. Type `npm install` also into your terminal from the same folder. 
4. Type `node server.js` into your terminal to start the server.

7. Type "http://localhost:8080/" into the URL and you will be able to sign up or sign in and use our online portal intuitively.
